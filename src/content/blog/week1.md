Its finally here. The week after Week 0. We've waited 6 entire days, gone nearly an entire week without college football on our screens. You've earned this:

## Week 1 CFB Review

I cant actually review every single game. Even if I could, I would not. No one is paying me for this shit.
In fact, it costs me marginally more for every miserable byte added to this document.
For this reason, enjoy an entirely random selection of FBS (and sometimes FCS) results from the past week:

##### South Florida 34 - 7 Boise State

##### Rutgers 34 - 31 Ohio

##### Wisconsin 17 - 0 Miami (OH)

##### Auburn 38 - 24 Baylor

##### Ohio State 14 - 7 Texas

##### LSU 17 - 10 Clemson

##### Florida State 31 - 17 Alabama

##### Michigan 34 - New Mexico 17

##### Kansas State 38 - 35 North Dakota

##### Miami 27 - 24 Notre Dame

##### TCU 48 - 14 North Carolina
