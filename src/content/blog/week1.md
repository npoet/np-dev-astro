Its finally here. The week after Week 0. We've waited 6 entire days, gone nearly an entire week without college 
football on our screens. You've earned this:

## Week 1 CFB Review

I cant actually review every single game. Even if I could, I would not. No one is paying me for this shit.
In fact, it costs me marginally more for every miserable byte added to this document.
For this reason, enjoy an entirely random selection of FBS (and sometimes FCS) results from the past week:

##### Rutgers 34 - 31 Ohio

Another 5 letters in that visiting team name and this is a great win.

##### Wisconsin 17 - 0 Miami (OH)

Similarly, not a great win.

##### Auburn 38 - 24 Baylor

Frankly not qualified to speak on such a dignified matchup, ask your local youth pastor.

##### Ohio State 14 - 7 Texas

Worst regular season game at the shoe since the last one, but they won this time!

##### LSU 17 - 10 Clemson

"Real" death valley settled?

##### Florida State 31 - 17 Alabama

Revenge complete.

##### Michigan 34 - 17 New Mexico

I like that Eck guy. Winning at the Rose Bowl in a couple of weeks. Book it. #NMUStadiumTour2k25

##### Kansas State 38 - 35 North Dakota

Last second touchdown to avoid disaster at home against North Dakota. This is the Week 0 effect

##### Miami 27 - 24 Notre Dame

Better than Northern Illinois, I guess.

##### TCU 48 - 14 North Carolina

Would like to throw my hat in the ring for the upcoming HC opening in Chapel Hill. I have at least 5 years life 
experience on the current Asst. Head Coach, and am at least as sane.
