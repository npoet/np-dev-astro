That bubble wrap cruise was exactly what I needed.

## Week 3 CFB Review

Some real bangers this week. Real mismanagement in Knoxville, real bad offense in Austin. See below:

##### Ohio State 37 - 9 Ohio

And you want people to watch this shit in primetime? Better learn Big Noon Forever buddy

##### LSU 20 - 10 Florida

Someone is a fraud here, not sure who yet. Keep an eye out

##### Miami 49 - 12 South Florida

"Felonious assault" - Notre Dame fans

##### Georgia 44 - 41 Tennessee (OT)

Tennessee fans would be very upset right now if they had internet access (or a decent HC)

##### Texas 27 - 10 UTEP

Arch was just being kind to a fellow UT System school. Nothing to see here.

##### Texas A&M 41 - 40 Notre Dame

(Touchdown) Jesus Christ himself assured victory for the Aggies after repeated attempts at robbery from rogue zebras.

##### Georgia Tech 24 - 21 Clemson

Dabo built his team in the name, image, and likeness of a Notre Dame fan. Bold strategy.

##### Michigan 63 - 3 Central Michigan

Bryce Underwood was unleashed and had me fired up, not sure what the Chips problem was.

##### West Virginia 31 - 24 Pitt (OT)

An FBS team has lost to Rich Rod in 2025.
