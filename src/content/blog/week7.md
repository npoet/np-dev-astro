I was busy this past weekend, so all 4 of you readers had to wait an insufferable amount of time for my thoughts. Your reward is additional thoughts. Gz.

## Week 7 CFB Review

The main benefit of waiting this long to post is my prediction about Frames Janklin has come through much earlier than anticipated. 

The biggest drawback is additional time to ponder the current state of Michigan Football. Its hard out here for a poster.

##### Missouri State 22 - 20 MTSU

The Wednesday night bangers are here, rejoice.

##### Washington 38 - 19 Rutgers

Hopefully they were too busy to watch any USC tape.

##### OSU 34 - 16 Illinois

Technically a trophy game alert

##### Indiana 30 - 20 Oregon

Indiana is for real, for real this time. In the delay getting this post out they've also extended the Cig; it's cowboy killers at IU from now on.

##### Weird Traitors 24 - 21 Wazzu

Is it not odd to anyone else that the "rebels" run out carrying American flags? FYI I've had fish that outlived the confederacy. Bring back reconstruction

##### Texas 23 - 6 Oklahoma

Shootout (trophy game) alert, Good Guy w/ Gun (unranked dawg) wins Red River *again*

##### Tennessee 34 - 31 Arkansas

SEC fans that have "read" to this point certainly cant be thrilled, but who knows its ur heritage not mine.

##### USC 31 - 13 Michigan

All I'll say is if we had fielded any ineligible players at any point in the past decade, the *vast network* would be vacating wins right now. Rule following just ain't for everybody

##### Mormons 33 - 27 Arizona (2OT)

In all seriousness that USC game was worrying. Even in previous losses of the Sherrone era UofM has not looked outmatched in the trenches to this degree, nor have players struggled to make their assignments with such frequency (on defense). I have nothing to say about the BYU game but good god man that sucked to watch.

##### Pitt 34 - 31 Florida State

FSU unranked again, that didn't last long. Hail Pitt.

##### UCLA 38 - 13 Michigan State

UCLA sudden contender in the B1G. Dangerous things happening in Westwood. MSU could use a Tuesday coaching swap as well

##### Troy 48 - 41 Texas State (OT)

Bonus football is good football. That's just the rule around here.

##### Hawai'i 44 - 26 Utah State

Bowl Eligible Hawai'i incoming

## Week 8 CFB Preview

Week 8 started Tuesday, beginning our month-long football slate for the season. This is normally the best time of the year, but we might all just be firing our coaches instead. To make up for the lack of a timely post and the angst of this past week, lets get in to some of the games this coming weekend: 

 ##### Louisville @ Miami (Fri 8/17)

We will find out Friday night if Miami is legit. This is a classic ACC letdown spot. But is it 2018 Miami or 2000 Miami? Time will tell.

##### Nebraska @ Minnesota (Fri 8/15)

B1G Friday night is for real teams only. Real bad home teams.

##### LSU @ Vandy

Diego Pavia will not allow his team to lose this game. Chalk it up

##### Washington @ Michigan

Jedd comes home to hopefully not ruin my year. Pls man.

##### Weird Traitors @ Georgia

Like the Mormons, the Weird Traitors have earned themselves a permanent nickname around here simply by continuing to exist in 2025.

Not sure what the textbooks in Mississippi are telling you but Jefferson Davis himself thought the rebels deserved no legacy. Literally enshrined loser mentality. Hotty Toddy

##### Oregon @ Rutgers

*Schiano chuckles*

*"I'm in danger"*

##### Wazzu @ Virginia

Given another shot at weird fascists I know the spirit of Mike Leach won't miss.

##### USC @ Notre Dame

More games should be played for weapons. Hatred for both of these teams aside, the Jeweled Shillelagh is one of the best CFB trophies.

##### Utah @ BYU

It would have been lame if the new CFB landscape robbed us of the Polynesian Bowl.

*Editors telling me that is an actual bowl game and not the nickname for this rivalry. Let the Holy War commence.*

Things got spicy this week. Keep your coaches close. Unless that buyout is cheap!
