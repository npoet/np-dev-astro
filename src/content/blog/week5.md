James Franklin has to be a plant. I'm not even sure how this one is his fault yet but good god

## Week 5 CFB Review

I don't feature schools in Charlottesville in these reviews but there was a field storming there Friday night, pleasantly devoid of pitchforks.

##### Arizona State 27 - 24 TCU

Another absolute thriller on Friday night. Best early week slate in recent memory

##### Georgia Tech 30 - 29 Wake Forest (OT)

##### Illinois 34 - 32 USC

##### Cincinnati 37 - 34 Kansas

##### Ohio State 24 - 6 Washington

##### Ole Miss 24 - 19 LSU

Did the over hit?

##### Indiana 20 - 15 Iowa

##### Northwestern 17 - 10 UCLA

##### Hawai'i 44 - 35 Air Force

##### Tennessee 41 - 34 Mississippi State (OT)

##### Oregon 30 - 24 Penn State (2OT)

##### Alabama 24 - 21 Georgia

##### Stanford 30 - 29 San Jose State

##### Cal Poly 32 - 24 Sac State

Poly wins in battle of... *checks notes*... *FBS hopefuls????*

##### Mormons 24 - 21 Coach Prime

Lame tbh
