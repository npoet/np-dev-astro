James Franklin has to be a plant. I'm not even sure how this one is his fault yet but good god

## Week 5 CFB Review

I don't feature schools in Charlottesville in these reviews but there was a field storming there Friday night, pleasantly devoid of pitchforks.

##### Arizona State 27 - 24 TCU

##### Georgia Tech 30 - 29 Wake Forest (OT)

##### Illinois 34 - 32 USC

##### Ole Miss 24 - 19 LSU

Did the over hit?
