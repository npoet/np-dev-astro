In my time reading other dev blogs I have discovered that they are mostly devoid of musings on 
American College Football. I intend to change that one week of results at a time. If you're looking for my thoughts 
on LLMs, cryptography, or EPL soccer, message me on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/osrs). 

I find myself spending personal time both obsessively watching games Thursday through Saturday and updating 
my ability to watch as many as possible at the same time via [cfbscores](https://github.com/npoet/cfbscores_py). Therefore, I think my time spent 
on this blog should reflect that. Allowing these thoughts to bounce around in my nearly empty head seems unhealthy, 
so without further ado:

## Week 0 CFB Review

Week 0 (or Week 1 in MATLAB) somehow continues to expand without Just Becoming Week 1 Already. 
In order to fully appreciate tuning in for 2 hours of commercials an entire week early, 
we need to understand some history:

#### How did we get here?

The concept of "Week 0" in college football has existed since 1983, when two once-relevant programs faced off a week 
early in a desperate attempt to get (any sober) viewers to watch them run the wishbone. 

An entire handful of Nebraska wins later its now 2025, and "Week 0" includes 5 FBS games in 1.5 democratic countries. 
My thoughts about pop warner level offenses aside, Week 0 has become a fun appetizer for fans of real programs who 
are still a week+ of fall practice away from their opening games. For Irish-American Holy Cross alums, however, 
its a rare opportunity to join the Fighting Irish on a trip to the Air Ligma stadium.

#### How can I watch?

Pay the mouse. And bezos. And Fox, Turner, NBC, and HBO. If only there was some way I could put a router on the roof 
and get all of the above. Maybe someday. You'll still need to hit streameast for FCS, Mountain West, 
98% of Hawai'i games. Prices increase next year.

#### How did it go?

##### Iowa State 24 - 21 Kansas State  
###### (&copy; Farmageddon)

Soup man good

##### UNLV 38 - 31 Idaho State

The fighting Alex Orgis outlast Ore-Ida (why wasn't this one in ireland???)

##### Kansas 31 - 7 Fresno State

I saw none of this game, but I hear they have jayden daniels at QB? Can't be a bad thing

##### Western Kentucky 41 - 24 Sam Houston

[insert Big Red eyes gif here]

##### Hawai'i 23 - 20 Stanford

Andrew Luck is out of eligibility.
