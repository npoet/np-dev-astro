I am not thrilled. Going to cover my new hypercar in bubble wrap and go drive carefully to take the edge off.

## Week 2 CFB Review

With the game of the week featuring two of the most storied programs in CFB history,
the regular season has finally begun. Unfortunately for the greater of these two programs it
began the way the 1975 season ended:

##### Oklahoma 24 - 13 Michigan

What the fuck is a sooner man

##### South Florida 18 - 16 Florida

Football is truly better when Florida's big 3 are back. Great to see Miami, Florida State, and some school in Tampa
achieve so much so early in the season.

##### Iowa State 16 - 13 Iowa

Have we seen this one before?

##### Baylor 48 - 45 SMU (2OT)

A holy war so hotly contested it required an extra 2 crusades. All of these heretics are out of luck regardless
(I went to Catholic school thats just what they told me).

##### NC State 35 - 31 Virginia

Nearly 70 points, somehow unwatchable, classic ACC football.

##### Syracuse 27 - 20 UCONN (OT)

Real football. Big East Football. Bring it back for Rutgers' sake.

##### Rutgers 45 - 17 Miami (OH)

The transitive property does not say good things about Wisconsin.

##### Michigan State 42 - 40 Boston College (2OT)

Boston College is a good team! They had that QB last year that just beat Alabama!

##### UNLV 30 - 23 UCLA

Another soon-to-be HC opening I'd be interested in being fired from next. Lmk.

##### BYU 27 - 3 Stanford

Jim Harbaugh wouldn't have stood for this.
