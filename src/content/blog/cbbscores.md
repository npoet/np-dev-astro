### Announcing hoops.npoet.dev

College basketball is back, and [hoops.npoet.dev](https://hoops.npoet.dev/) is here just in time. In previous years 
I've added college hoops data directly to [scores.npoet.dev](https://scores.npoet.dev/), but obviously things are a 
bit different between various forms of football and basketball. 

To support more statistical expansion and avoid too much clutter on the football scores page, all basketball is moving 
over to [hoops.npoet.dev](https://hoops.npoet.dev/) as of today. In the coming weeks there will be further updates, 
more live data, and statistical references like we have for college football now. 

To start, the scoreboard feeds for NCAA Men's Division 1 and NBA Basketball are available. Check the site for updates.
