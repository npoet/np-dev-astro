## Championship Week CFB Review

Alabama deserved to play another Citrus Bowl stinker against a superior program (Texas will be honored). Instead they get rewarded at Notre Dame's demise. This is a hard one for me. Results below:

##### JMU 31 - 14 Troy

JMU pulls away late, awaits result in ACC basketball showcase this Saturday.

##### Tulane 34 - 21 North Texas

Green Wave to the 'offs

##### Texas Tech 34 - 7 BYU

Just how the Big XII crumbls.

##### Indiana State 29 - 28 North Dakota State

FCS shocker in Fargo

##### Georgia 28 - 7 Alabama

Yeah sure just put em in there anyway. Who cares.

##### Indiana 13 - 10 an Ohio State University

Ryan Day and 13 - 10 is a match made in football heaven.

Some programs just don't have what it takes to go 15-0

##### Duke 27 - 20 Virginia (OT)

"Duke will not replace us!"

But *The Dukes* sure will

## The Playoff Bracket is set

### CFP Preview

First Round Matchup (Quarterfinal Matchup)

##### #9 Alabama @ #8 Oklahoma (Rose Bowl vs. #1 Indiana)

Sure let's just do it again.

##### #10 Miami @ #7 Texas A&M (Cotton Bowl vs. #2 Ohio State)

If only these two had a common opponent.

##### #11 Tulane @ #6 Ole Miss (Sugar Bowl vs. #3 Georgia)

Why not?

##### #12 JMU @ #5 Oregon (Orange Bowl vs. #4 Texas Tech)

It was fun while it lasted.

Semi-finals will be played at the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl.

We'll be back after each round of the playoffs.
