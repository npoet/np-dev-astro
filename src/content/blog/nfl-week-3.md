People have been asking, why no thoughts on the NFL?

###### Update: Mike Vrabel *you* just lost at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. *What are you gonna do now?*

See below for thoughts:

## Weeks 1-3 NFL Review

I have thoughts on the NFL. Normally I'd have (many) more thoughts but a special set of never-before-seen circumstances 
have arisen that apparently cannot be avoided.

#### The Background:

For the first time in the history of the NFL, the Pittsburgh Steelers have a truly reprehensible individual starting 
under center. My once proud team has gone from a long string of proven winners and role models like Charlie Batch, 
only to find themselves paying millions of dollars to fund Aaron Rodgers' ayahuasca habit. Throughout my childhood, 
I could always look to the Steelers QB for a model of resilience, sound decision-making skills, and the blue-collar 
spirit that makes Pittsburgh special. Instead, we have a man that specializes in burning bridges, channeling crystals, 
and probably wears a helmet on his electric motorcycle. 

Lest we forget this individual won his only Super Bowl against our storied franchise; Aaron Rodgers needs to win at 
least 3 before we can forgive his transgressions. Personally, I'll need to hear about a playoff win from another 
source before this team gets any attention outside of NFL Redzone. This is a sad state of affairs to be sure, but I 
said I wouldn't watch a single second if we signed that clown and want to be at least partially true to that statement.

#### Aren't you from Michigan?

Sure, but I grew up in a household that occasionally watched winning football. My hometown pro team, the Detroit Lions, 
have conversely been unwatchable for nearly my entire existence. I have fond memories of attending bag-head-era games 
for nearly $0 (to watch Dan Campbell!). Of this finally being the year Matt Stafford wins a Super Bowl. 
Of that time our head coach almost fought Jim Harbaugh. Not so much the early retiring two of the greatest skill players 
to ever grace the field at their respective positions.

Times have changed. The Lions renaissance of the 2020s has been both beautiful and terrifying. Only the Lions could rip 
the heart out of the city of Detroit like they did last season. And the 60 seasons prior. And we're all happily giving 
them the opportunity to do it all over again. Expectations for the Lions feel seriously foreign and almost as exciting 
as they are pressurizing. The Barry Sanders jersey is more than a darty staple in 2025.

That being said, I will never truly be an optimistic Lions fan. Call me fairweather, or a bandwagoner (false), but this 
is a natural defense mechanism born of far too many years only getting Lions games on FOX every Sunday. It is flat out 
unhealthy to allow that team too much room in one's rooting intentions. I'll always be pro Lions, even against the 
Steelers (for as long as our QB is an unvaccinated manchild who wronged Danica Patrick), but I can't allow myself to be 
negatively affected by what can only be described as a fucking cursed organization. 
My mental is too fragile to begin with.

#### The Games:

Was there a review in there? Not really. Will there be? Also no.

Check back for more in Week 6. I need a break. Go Blue.

##### Don't buy drugs kids (become a quarterback and they give them to you for free).
