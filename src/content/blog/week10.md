Why is no one streaming Hawai'i at a time like this?

## Week 10 CFB Review 

I think I managed to find every single one of the most unwatchable games of the week. Real mind melting stuff. Luckily I caught the Mountain West nightcap in the 4th quarter. More below.

##### North Carolina 27 - 10 Syracuse



##### Idaho 35 - 32 NAU (OT)

We watch FCS around here too

##### Texas 34 - 31 Vanderbilt

They're baaaack?

##### SMU 26 - 20 Miami (OT)

Miami, on the other hand, is never back.

##### West Virginia 45 - 35 Houston



##### Duke 46 - 45 Clemson



##### Arizona State 24 - 19 Iowa State



##### Michigan 21 - 16 Purdue



##### USC 21 - 17 Nebraska

Another Top 25 loss for the corn lovers

##### Kentucky 10 - 3 Auburn

##### +

##### Oregon State 10 - 7 Washington State

Shitshow double feature of the week, watch both for the combined offensive action of one normally shitty game.

##### San Jose State 45 - 38 Hawai'i

Comeback comes up just short. Hawai'i had two hands on the onside kick
