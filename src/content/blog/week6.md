Considered not changing the image this week. Frames Janklin just lost to some random guy UCLA brought in to run the offense on Tuesday. Maybe they should hire him 

## Week 6 CFB Review

Fire Luke Fickell.

##### Western Kentucky 27 - 24 Delaware

We really deserved bonus football in this one.

##### Manchester United 2 - 0 Sunderland

AT LAST

##### Cincinnati 38 - 30 Iowa State

Nothing to see here, nor the last game mentioned. Just normal college football results.

##### Michigan 24 - 10 Wisconsin

Fickell should consider himself lucky that Michigan decided not to punish him for that sad field goal. We'll see if Chris McIntosh is feeling as generous. 

##### Baylor 35 - 34 Kansas State

Classic Big XII ball

##### Navy 34 - 31 Air Force

Should've known the team with far more planes would get the job done. Go Navy

##### UCLA 42 - 37 Penn State

UCLA has a new offensive coordinator. Penn State has a new head coach in 2027.

##### Florida 29 - 21 Texas

Why in the world did they allow Arch to be hyped to this degree

##### Alabama 30 - 14 Vanderbilt

Bama with a quality win over Vanderbilt. What a sentence.

##### Washington 24 - 20 Maryland

I actually removed this game from the quadbox. I made a serious mistake. 20 point comeback for Washington while I watched some garbage in the lower left corner instead.

##### App State 27 - 23 Oregon State

It might have been this game actually. Awful way to lose for OSU

##### Nebraska 38 - 27 Michigan State

Superior corn growers show dominance, avoid consecutive home losses to progressively worse teams from the state of Michigan.

##### Miami 28 - 22 Florida State

Miami is back. For real this time

##### Texas A&M 31 - 9 Mississippi State

Cowbells coming back down to earth quickly

##### UC Davis 34 - 27 Cal Poly

###### TROPHY GAME ALERT

Davis retains the Golden Horseshoe

##### Montana 42 - 38 Idaho State

FCS thriller alert, big win for the Grizz.

##### Duke scored more points than Cal.

Dont let the (lack of) a score fool you. Whats really important is going on in the classroom.



###### This one was quick. Right from the hip. Isn't that how Bill Belichick is currently coaching?

###### Side note: Go Tigers
