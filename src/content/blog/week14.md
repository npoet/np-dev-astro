The regular season is at an end. That was fast.

## Week 14 CFB Review

There is an actual head coach of a top 10 team leaving for another job in the middle of the championship push.

##### Weird Traitors win the egg bowl

And their best ever on-field campaign will also end in reconstruction. 

I'm sensing a theme.

##### Ohio 31 - 26 Buffalo

Oiho to the MAC title game

##### Kent State 35 - 31 NIU

Glad some teams still care to score, they all seem to be in the MAC

##### Georgia 16 - 9 Georgia Tech

The sort of ugly that Michigan wanted today.

##### Texas 27 - 17 Texas A&M

The sort of ugly that A&M is probably just used to by now.

##### Michigan 9 - 27 OSU

Yikes. Only 2 thoughts:

Touchback. And:

I miss Justice Haynes.

##### Iowa State 20 - 13 Oklahoma State

Nearly a 2nd win for the worst OKST team I've ever seen.

##### Yale 43 - 42 Youngstown State

2nd half explosion in the first year of Ivy eligibility

Harvard not so much

##### Oklahoma 17 - 13 LSU

Congrats to the new home of Lane Kiffin and co on almost winning this game.

Doesn't he look happy?

##### Vanderbilt 45 - 24 Tennessee

Playoff Pavia??

##### Minnesota 17 - 7 Wisconsin

This game involves a large axe. Who needs your playoff.

##### Penn State 40 - 36 Rutgers

What if they win out, huh?

##### Kennesaw State 48 - 42 Liberty (2OT)

There's a low-hanging Liberty joke in here but they fired that guy. Too bad.

##### Army 27 - 24 UTSA

Army succeeds at the Alamo(dome)

##### Michigan State 38 - 28 Maryland

MSU finally wins "conference" game, promptly fires John L. Smith II

Maryland knows this is not the cycle for them to be hiring.

##### Alabama 27 - 20 Auburn

Lane Kiffin was that close to skipping an SEC title game too

##### Cal 38 - 35 SMU

A classic ACC matchup. 

Much like Duke and Virginia in the conference title game.

And neither deserve to even dream about the playoff. What a conference.

##### Hawai'i 27 - 7 Wyoming

Rainbow Warriors finish with 8 wins, 2 points from an undefeated home season.

### Conference Championship Week Preview

Plenty of games this coming week. I am struggling to care at this moment. The games:

##### Sun Belt: Troy - JMU

##### American: North Texas - Tulane

##### Mountain West: UNLV - Boise State

##### Big XII: BYU - Texas Tech

##### MAC: Miami-OH - Western Michigan

##### SEC: Georgia - Alabama

##### B1G: Indiana - Ohio State

Check back next week, maybe we'll even discuss.
