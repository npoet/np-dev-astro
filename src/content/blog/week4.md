Before Matt Rhule says anything, Connor Stalions was with me at his mom's house the whole time.

## Week 4 CFB Review

This one is going live before the late night games have even started on the West Coast. Expect periodic updates until USC is done rolling over John Smith. Personally I needed to get the initial thoughts out in order to not celebrate the *real* 1997 National Championship too hard.

##### Tulsa 19 - 12 Oklahoma State

Shockingly close hook and ladder alert

##### Iowa 38 - 28 Rutgers

One has to appreciate Ferentz's ability to turn literally any quarterback into Davis Warren. Clearly this is not a shot at *hero and winner* Davis Warren so you figure it out.

##### Maryland 27 - 10 Wisconsin

Possibly no coach on earth more fired than Fickell atm

##### Syracuse 34 - 21 Clemson

Except Dabo?? 15 missed calls from Tyler from Spartanburg.

##### Texas Tech 34 - 10 Utah

Definitely picked this one on Friday and can't be bothered to use the delete key. Backup QB looks just fine for TTU.

##### Oklahoma 24 - 17 Auburn

... another Oklahoma player has hit the quarterback ... 

##### Michigan 30 -  27 Nebraska

Didn't you see this coming? The *&copy;Vast Network* did.Â Justice Haynes for Heisman (and open tryouts ASAP for WR). 

##### Eastern Michigan 34 - 31 UL Lafayette

A walkoff win in Ypsi!

##### Indiana (a lot) - (a little) Illinois (it is the 2nd quarter at the time of writing)

Anyone that believed in Bielema should have their head examined immediately after his is studied for science. Indiana probably stole your signs.
