### Background

Before this site and its [scores](https://scores.npoet.dev/) domain were active, getting a bunch of results
or live scores on one page for free (without a wall of ads) was getting more difficult than it should be.
My primary affected interests being American football and EPL soccer, I went searching for a better source of data.

There are plenty of paid sources out there, ranging from very reasonable pricing like our friends at
[CFBData](https://collegefootballdata.com/), to enterprise-focused pricing models that quickly spiralled
out of my range. I was unable to find any single source that covered all of my needs for a reasonable price,
unfortunately.

It turns out, a certain Disney-owned sports giant uses a simple, open API to feed their
increasingly bloated set of webpages and betting apps. There is a popular GitHub repo
dedicated to documenting this "hidden" API, and it was a great starting point for the FBScores
project. Since the 2021-2022 football season I've been building and using FBScores as a local
tool to watch (and occasionally bet on) as many games as possible.

### CFBScores

The scores [island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) on this site is a simple "windowed"
version of what can be found on scores.npoet.dev. MDX files like the one this page is rendered
from allow us to imbed client-side islands the same way:

<ScoreboardIsland client:load />

I've gone through several style iterations and finally like the look of most things on the scores
site, but it was designed with my monitors/devices in mind and definitely doesn't scale
perfectly yet. At a minimum, I can quickly find out what games are on and where to find them.
The cells on this site link to the scores page, but their counterparts there expand on-click to
show statistics, box scores, and live information when available.

#### Future Updates

In addition to minor style tweaks to better support every screen that the site might be
viewed on, there are some performance and cost improvements that are planned for the
future. I am currently only making significant use of server-side caching in the team stats
component (seen on the front page of this site for example), and could significantly reduce
calls to the "hidden API" by caching game data as well. In the time between live games that
often occurs from Sunday/Monday night to Thursday, rarely any data will change outside of
betting lines. Betting lines being the only relevant data changing in downtime, we can
safely cache the scores data and only refresh the cache every couple of hours when games aren't live.

Beyond efficiency improvements I plan to better integrate the CFBData API in the very near future.
There is a wealth of information available for statistical analysis and I will be creating
some new visualizations and a comparison tool to expand the team data resource. Previously
I would use the links on the scores site to do additional betting research elsewhere, but
the incorporation of more CFBData features could easily eclipse my current 3rd party sources.

The [code](https://github.com/npoet/cfbscores_py) (and [code](https://github.com/npoet/cfbscores_react))
itself could still use plenty of cleanup, but the API especially is in a decent state. I will continue
to make small improvements on both ends, with more async support for latency improvements coming
in the next week or so.

### an-osrs-project

This silly project was the idea of a fellow XP-waster at the W420 G.E. If you don't know
what any of this means, good for you. Feel free to stop reading at any time you see fit.

It is obviously essential to get a good *fashionscape* on to flex on noobs after printing gp
at the delve boss all day. To get a better idea of how my pixelated investments are
performing, I built this simple tool you may have seen on the index page:

<EquipValueIsland client:load />

The RuneScape Wikis are an excellent community resource, and they are very generous with their API
policies. However, if we somehow blow things up and hear from them on Discord, I'll likely implement
more caching here too. I don't necessarily need the sheer number of data points represented
in the graph, nor the update frequency, but they allow it and it works quickly with the current
async implementation.

While the gif file in the GitHub README is likely not up to date at any given time, it is a
decent representation of the type of swag we're working with here. This account stays spooned.

#### Future Updates

Constant thoughts of caching aside, it would be nice to have more merching features within this
tool. I like the graph library provided by [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US), and would be using
effectively the same "real-time" data available on the prices wiki. I don't really have an immediate
need for it, but expect some new features here sometime soon as well.

If we could somehow get a live integration with a RuneLite plugin going instead of a JSON-based
setup, that would be the ideal situation for this tool. I'm sure this is possible, but I've never
attempted anything similar and don't necessarily have it high on my current TODO list.

### npoet.dev infrastructure

The site infrastructure is fairly simple, but I wanted to outline my design choices and plans for my cloud
resources as well. Currently my API and domain frontends are hosted in EC2 ARM instances. I'm using a fairly
standard proxy and ingress but that's as detailed as we'll get here. Not like you're getting past Cloudflare
but you can't be too careful.

Costs and CPU overhead are kept nice and low in this configuration, but my resources are not replicated
and are currently solely located in one of the us-west clusters. Latency from the east coast doesnt seem
to be a problem as of now (according to a friend), but an ELB and replicated EKS setup would be a sensible future
plan if the scores site specifically is ever in need of some scale. That would be a good problem to have, and
though these are not currently running in Docker containers that's only a click or so away.

#### Future Updates

In a scenario where the site requires elastic resources at a greater scale, I'll want to relocate the
cache and databasing off-instance and into (likely) DocumentDB and/or ElastiCache hosted thru AWS.

As this and the scores site are updated in the future, I may create a new version of this document. I don't
have any current plans for new widgets on this site necessarily, but I'm sure something will come to me
eventually.
